# Mission-to-Mars

This code automates a web browser to visit different NASA websites to extract data about the Mission to Mars. The data is then stored in a NoSQL database, and rendered in a web application created with Flask.

The following tools were used for building the application:

  - HTML elements, as well as class and id attributes, to identify content for web scraping.
  - BeautifulSoup and Splinter to automate a web browser and perform a web scrape.
  - MongoDB database to store data from the web scrape.
  - Flask to display the data from the web scrape.
  - Bootstrap components to polish and customize the portfolio.
